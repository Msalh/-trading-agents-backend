"""
Coordinator/Analysis divergence + ablation diagnostic — Tier 3.16.

Every backtest-lite result since Tier 3.10 has shown Coordinator's own
blended decision performing at or below Analysis alone, and Tier 3.12/
3.14's paired and grid comparisons went further: on the current
(small) accepted-candidate sets, Coordinator and Analysis produced
byte-for-byte IDENTICAL trade outcomes. The third external review
endorsed investigating this directly, but pushed back on doing it as a
shallow "are the two directions identical?" check — that conflates
several genuinely different situations (Coordinator agreeing with
Analysis, Coordinator abstaining where Analysis had an opinion,
Coordinator actively overriding Analysis, Coordinator unable to decide
at all) into one number, and misses the more important question: does
Coordinator's blending (News/Macro/Timing on top of Analysis) ever
actually change what would have happened, and is that change additive
(catches bad Analysis calls, adds real signal) or just noise/cost?

This module answers that with tooling that already exists rather than
new scoring logic: every trade candidate already freezes its full
opinions_used/contributions/conflict_flags snapshot (Tier 2.1), and
app/replay.py's replay_candidate() can already re-score that frozen
snapshot under a hypothetical weights dict entirely offline. The
"ablation" here is exactly that: replay each candidate with one
directional agent's weight zeroed out and see whether the final
decision changes — a real causal answer ("would this specific decision
have been different without News?"), not just a correlational one
("how often do Analysis and Coordinator happen to agree?").

Read-only, offline, no LLM calls, no new candidates or trades — this
walks candidate history exactly as backtest.py and replay.py already
do. COORDINATOR_THRESHOLD and Coordinator scoring are untouched;
zeroing a weight for a single replay pass here never touches the live
WEIGHTS config used for real decisions.
